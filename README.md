# sci_project
ros based comparison for computer vision


# some basic notes for the project:
- taking data from formula student team, in order to have leg-up. this is in cooperation with the team.
- will look specifically at blue cones. blue cones have class '1' in the data. ('0' is yellow)
- in *.txt data, first column is class. 2nd & 3rd refer to row (height) percentage, 4 & 5 refer to column (width)
- bounding rectangles seem to be drawn from bottom-left to top-right
- friendly reminder: in opencv, colors are by default BGR (blue-green-red)
